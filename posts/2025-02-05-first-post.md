# Hello World

I started coding in 1991 as a computer programmer in the USAF. Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple technologies, but somewhere along the way, I lost touch with the kind of hands-on coding that initially drew me in. Now, I’m getting back to what I do best—**building something real, something powerful.**

This GitHub is a **clean slate**. No bloated repositories, no outdated projects—just **deliberate, high-value work**.
