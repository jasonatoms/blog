# Rebuilding from the Ground Up: My GitHub Reboot & AI Knowledge System

I started coding in 1991 as a computer programmer in the USAF. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across multiple technologies, but somewhere along the way, I lost touch with the kind of hands-on coding that initially drew me in. Now, Iâ€™m getting back to what I do bestâ€”**building something real, something powerful.**

This GitHub is a **clean slate**. No bloated repositories, no outdated projectsâ€”just **deliberate, high-value work**. My first major project is a **self-hosted AI-driven knowledge augmentation system**. Think of it as an **autonomous, evolving research assistant** that learns from my workflow instead of being just another static note-taking tool.

## Project Overview: Local AI Knowledge Engine

### ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

- **Python** (FastAPI, SQLite/PostgreSQL for metadata storage)
- **FAISS/ChromaDB** (Vector-based search and retrieval)
- **CLI/API-First Approach** (Minimalist, no distractions)

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features

âœ… **Semantic Search & Retrieval** â€“ AI-driven indexing for instant, contextual recall.  
âœ… **Auto-Linking & Query Prediction** â€“ Dynamic knowledge connections, not just keyword search.  
âœ… **Spaced Repetition & Resurfacing** â€“ A system that brings back important concepts over time.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Self-Hosted** â€“ Controlled, private, and fully customizable.

Currently, Iâ€™m hosting the prototype on a **lightweight AWS EC2 instance**, but Iâ€™m considering other options for **stability, cost-effectiveness, and multi-device access**.

## Why This? Why Now?

Iâ€™m done wasting time on platforms like LinkedIn that serve as little more than corporate posturing. Iâ€™m here to **build**, refine my craft, and work on something that solves a real problem. This project aligns with everything I believe inâ€”**efficiency, intelligence, and self-reliance**.

If youâ€™re into **AI, knowledge systems, or just respect brutal efficiency**, letâ€™s connect. Expect more updates as I iterate and refine.

ðŸš€ **First commit coming soon.**
